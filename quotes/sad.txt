All-day is not the same, you need to wait and be patient for the good things to happen.
Crying alone does not show that you are weak but it shows that you are strong.
Wipeout your own tears, because if people come to you they will come for a deal.
When you feel the pain, just remember its the signal that your sins are getting less.
Never compare yourself with others because they dont know your bad time and you dont know about theirs.
